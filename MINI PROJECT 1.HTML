        <div id="Eduction">
            Batra was born on 9 September 1974, in a Punjabi Khatri family[1] in a small town in Palampur, Himachal
            Pradesh. He was the third child of Girdhari Lal Batra, a government school principal, and Kamal Kanta
            Batra, a school teacher. He was the elder of twin sons, born fourteen minutes before his brother,
            Vishal. The twins were nicknamed: 'Luv' (Vikram) and 'Kush' (Vishal), after the twin sons of the Hindu
            deity Rama, by their mother who was a professed devotee of Rama.[2] He had two sisters: Seema and
            Nutan.[3] As a young child, Batra received his primary education under the tutelage of his mother.[4][5]
            He then attended the D.A.V. Public School in Palampur, where he studied up to middle standard.[4] He
            received his senior secondary education at Central School in Palampur.[4][5]

            Besides his academic endeavours, Batra also dabbled in a variety of sports at his school, which he
            represented at the national level during the Youth Parliamentary competitions in Delhi. He also
            represented his school and college in table tennis, Karate and other such sports. In 1990, he and his
            twin brother represented their school in table tennis at All India KVS Nationals.[6][5][7][8] He also
            was a green belt holder in Karate and went on to attend a national level camp in Manali.[9]

            After completing his Class XII board examinations in 1992 from Central School, he attended DAV College,
            Chandigarh in B.Sc Medical Sciences.[5][9] At college, he joined the Air Wing of the National Cadet
            Corps (NCC) while he was in his first year.[10] During the Inter-State NCC Camp, he was adjudged the
            best NCC Air Wing cadet of Punjab Directorate in North Zone.[11][12] He was selected and underwent a
            40-day paratrooping training with his NCC Air Wing unit at Pinjore Airfield and Flying Club, about 35
            kilometres away from Chandigarh.[5][13] During the next two years in DAV, he remained a cadet of the
            Army Wing of NCC.[10] In addition, he was the president of the Youth Service Club of his college.[10]

            He afterward qualified for the 'C' certificate in the NCC and attained the rank of Senior Under Officer
            in his NCC unit.[12] Subsequently, in 1994, he was selected and took part in the Republic Day parade as
            an NCC cadet, and when he came back home, he told his parents that he wanted to join the Army.[8][14]
            His maternal grandfather was also a soldier in the Indian Army.[8] In 1995, while still in college, he
            was selected for the merchant navy at a shipping company headquartered in Hong Kong, but ultimately he
            changed his mind, aspiring to do "something great, something extraordinary, which may bring fame to my
            country."[5][8][15] That same year he completed his bachelor's degree, graduating from the DAV College
            in Chandigarh.[16]

            Following completion of his bachelor's degree in 1995, he enrolled at Panjab University in Chandigarh,
            where he took admission in MA English course, so that he could prepare for the Combined Defence Services
            (CDS) Examination.[10][11][17] He attended evening classes at the University and worked part-time in the
            morning as a branch manager of a travelling agency in Chandigarh.[10][12]

            In 1996, he passed the CDS examination and subsequently received a call for an interview at the Services
            Selection Board (SSB) at Allahabad and was selected.[18] He was among the top 35 candidates in the Order
            of Merit.[18] After completing a year (session 1995—96) towards the degree of MA in English, he left the
            University to join the Indian Military Academy.[16][19]

            Batra joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun, in June 1996 in the Manekshaw Battalion.[20]
            After completing his 19-month training course, he graduated from the IMA on 6 December 1997 and was
            commissioned as a lieutenant into the Indian Army.[21] He was commissioned into the 13th battalion of the
            Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif). After commissioning, he was sent to Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh for
            regimental training. The training lasted one month, from December 1997 to the end of January 1998.[22]

            On completion of this training he got his first posting at Sopore in Baramulla district of Jammu and
            Kashmir, an area with significant militant activity.[22] In mid-March 1998, he was sent to the Infantry
            School at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, where young Army officers are trained, for the Young Officer's Course. This
            training lasted five months until September 1998. Following completion of the course and being awarded alpha
            grading, he joined his battalion in Sopore in October 1998.[5][22]

            During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with militants. In one of those encounters when
            Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped when bullet fired by a
            militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, who was killed. Batra ordered his men
            to fire on the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed.[23][24] He believed that the
            bullet was meant for him and not his colleague.[25]

            In January 1999, Batra was sent on a Commando Course at Belgaum, Karnataka. The course lasted for two months
            and at the end of it, he was awarded the highest grading — the Instructor's Grade.[26]

            Every time when he came home to Palampur on leave, he would visit the Neugal Cafe.[25] Batra last came home
            on leave from the army in 1999, during the Holi festival for a few days.[27][25][28] <br>
            <h3 class="heading" id="kargil War"> The Kargil War</h3>
            Batra's battalion, the 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif), reached Dras on 6 June, was placed under
            the command of 56 Mountain Brigade, and was given orders to act as reserves to the 2nd battalion of the
            Rajputana Rifles (2 Raj Rif) during their attack on Tololing mountain.[32] The 18th battalion of The
            Grenadiers (18 Grenadiers) first attacked Tololing on 22 May, but were unable to capture the
            peak.[34][35][36] 18 Grenadiers made four attempts to capture Tololing,[37][38] but could only succeed in
            securing the lower slopes,[39][40] while suffering heavy casualties.[38][41] Eventually, 2 Raj Rif was
            assigned the mission of capturing Tololing and they did so on 13 June 1999.[36]

            After the capture of Tololing, 13 JAK Rif marched from Dras to Tololing, reaching their destination in 12
            hours.[42] Upon reaching, Alpha company of 13 JAK Rif took over Tololing and a portion of the Hump Complex
            from 18 Grenadiers.[42] <br>

            <h3 class="heading" id="5140">The capture of Point 5140</h3>
            The task of capturing Point 5140, a strategically important mountain peak in the Dras sector, was
            assigned to 13 JAK Rif under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Kumar Joshi on 17 June
            1999.[43][32] After the capture of Rocky Knob, located at the base of Point 5140 and about 800 metres
            away,[44][45] Humps IX and X (part of Hump Complex, consisting of about ten high grounds numbered I to X
            on the same ridgeline about 500–700 metres north of Point 4590[32][46]) on 17 June, the battalion's
            commanding officer, Joshi, fell back to Tololing, and started planning for their next objective — Point
            5140.[47][48] Point 5140, about 1500 metres north of Tololing on the same ridgeline,[44] is at an
            altitude of 16,962 feet above sea level and overlooks the Tololing nullah.[45][49] It is the highest
            point on the Tololing ridgeline and the most formidable feature in the Dras sub-sector.[50][51][42]

            On 18 June, the battalion carried out a detailed reconnaissance of Point 5140 which revealed the enemy
            had put in place seven sangars on the feature; two on the top, four towards the east and one towards the
            north.[52][53] It also revealed the eastern approach to the feature was comparatively easier than that
            from the front, which had a near vertical climb, dominated by the top, though it was also more heavily
            defended.[52] It was decided the assaulting troops must capture the Top before dawn, or else the enemy
            would inflict maximum casualties on them.[52][54]

            Joshi decided to attack Point 5140 with Bravo Company, under the command of Lieutenant Sanjeev Singh
            Jamwal, and Delta Company, under the command of Lieutenant Vikram Batra, from two sides; East and
            South.[42][52] At the Hump Complex, the two officers, Jamwal and Batra, received their briefing about
            the mission from Joshi.[42] During the briefing, Jamwal chose the words "Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!" to be
            the success signal for his company whilst Batra chose the words "Yeh Dil Mange More!" (This heart wants
            more! — from a popular advertising slogan of Pepsi) as his success signal for his
            company.[55][42][52][56] D-Day was set for 19 June, and H-Hour at 20:30.[52][a]

            Under the cover of artillery fire, the two assault companies began climbing Point 5140 after midnight on
            20 June.[55][43] The artillery at Hump Complex had already begun its preparatory bombardment of Point
            5140.[57] As planned, the artillery guns would stop firing when the troops were 200 metres short of the
            objective.[54]

            Once the artillery guns, including the MBRLs and 105 mm guns, had ceased firing, the Pakistani soldiers
            immediately came out of their bunkers and put down heavy fire with their machine guns on the advancing
            Indian soldiers. At that moment, both Jamwal and Batra, contacted commanders at the base via radio,
            asking to continue artillery bombardment of the enemy positions till the companies were 100 metres from
            their target.[54]

            By 0315 hours, both B and D Companies had reached the vicinity of Point 5140 despite the treacherous
            terrain.[55] B company reached the top of the feature first and assaulted from the left flank.[55] By
            0330 hours, B company had captured its objective,[52] and at 0335 hours Jamwal radioed his command post,
            saying the words "Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"[55]

            Batra decided to approach the hill from the rear,[25] aiming to surprise the enemy,[58] and to cut off
            their withdrawal route.[59] Batra fired three rockets towards the bunkers on the east side of the
            feature, before attacking them.[60] He and his men ascended the sheer rock-cliff, but as the group
            neared the top, the enemy pinned them on the face of the bare cliff with machine gun fire.[59] Batra,
            along with five of his men, climbed up and after reaching the top, hurled two grenades at the machine
            gun post.[59][28] Batra then killed three enemy soldiers single-handedly in close combat.[59][28] He was
            seriously injured in the process,[59][28] but insisted on regrouping his men to continue with the
            mission.[59] He continued to lead his troops, and then charged at the next enemy position, capturing
            Point 5140.[59] In all its actions, his company killed at least eight Pakistani intruders and recovered
            a heavy anti-aircraft machine gun.[5] The remaining enemy soldiers fled.[60]

            At 0435 hours, Batra radioed his command post, saying the words "Yeh dil mange more!".[60] Considerable
            quantities[vague] of arms and ammunition were recovered from the feature. The captured munitions
            indicated the enemy's strength was about a platoon.[60] Neither B or D companies suffered any casualties
            in the battle.[61][62] The capture of Point 5140 set in motion a string of successes, such as the
            captures of Point 5100, Point 4700, Junction Peak and the Three Pimple Complex.

            After the capture of Point 5140, Batra was promoted to the rank of captain.[63] General Ved Prakash
            Malik, the then Chief of Army Staff, called to congratulate him. All across the nation, his triumph was
            being played out on television screens.[25]

            On 26 June, shortly after the capture of Point 5140, 13 JAK Rif was ordered to move from Dras to Ghumri
            to rest, refit, and recoup.[60][61] The battalion then moved to Mushkoh Valley on 30 June.[60] <br>

            <h3 class="heading" id="4875">The capture of Point 4875</h3>

            Just before leaving, Batra along with the 25 men of his Delta Company, who were to accompany him,
            prayed at the Durga Mata temple.[63][78] It was pitch black night when they began the climb.[79]
            Having heard a wireless message from the base that Sher Shah (Batra's code name) was coming, a cheer
            went up among the Indian soldiers on top. The commander ordered them to hold their ground until Sher
            Shah arrived and then he would take over.[78]

            On the night of 6–7 July, the opposing forces were so close that besides exchanges of small arms
            fire, verbal exchanges continued throughout the night.[66][75] It was at this stage where it became
            imperative for Indian troops to destroy this Pakistani post, located north of Point 4875, from where
            enemy fire was coming as otherwise the situation could become worse.[66] At this juncture, the
            Indian troops detected the enemy presence on a long and narrow ledge, running north from Point 4875.
            On the ledge, the enemy were holding strong sangars echeloned one behind the other.[66] Batra, who
            was still recovering from his own wounds he received in the battle of Point 5140, wanted to reach
            the top to rescue his fellow soldiers and carry out reconnaissance of the ledge where the enemy
            soldiers were.[77][80] It was pitch dark when they had left at night, but even near the top where
            the soldiers had to climb vertically, visibility was almost zero because of fog and snow. En route
            to the top, Batra spotted a Pakistani machine gun position firing at the trapped Indian soldiers.
            Crouching, he moved toward the machine gun position, hiding behind rocks whenever possible. As he
            reached close to the enemy's machine gun position he lobbed a grenade, destroying the machine gun
            position.[80] Before first light on the 7th, the troops succeeded in knocking out two more enemy
            machine guns, however, firing from the ledge continued.[80] Batra's platoon soon reached the ledge,
            though by this time it was broad daylight.[81]

            At 0530 hours Lt. Col. Joshi spoke to Batra and asked him to reconnoitre the area.[82] Batra,
            accompanied by Subedar Raghunath Singh and Major Bhat, his artillery observation officer, took out a
            patrol to recce a route to re-inforce Naveen from a flank.[83] Batra located the position of the
            enemy sangar on the ledge from which enemy machine guns were holding up the advance of his
            company.[83] At this juncture, Batra, realising there was no way from the left or right, decided to
            make a direct assault in daylight itself.[82] Under heavy fire from enemy machine guns and grenade
            firing launchers, Batra moved forward, screaming the battle cry of JAK RIF – Durga mata ki jai,[84]
            and charged the sangar firing incessantly from his AK-47. He sustained grievous injuries in the
            process, yet he continued his charge, with supporting fire from the rest of the patrol, and upon
            reaching the very narrow entrance of the sangar and taking the enemy by complete surprise, he killed
            5 Pakistani soldiers in a close-quarter battle.[82][83][84][85][86] The attack resulted in seven
            Pakistani soldiers killed[84] after which the Indians gained a foothold on the ledge.[82] Taken by
            surprise by the attack, Pakistanis started retreating. Batra and his men had gained the upper hand
            by now.[84] Batra pulled out a bleeding Naveen from the bunker.[87] However, there was still an
            enemy machine gun nest in action on that ledge that had to be silenced. Four Pakistani soldiers
            including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), who was guiding the fire on the Indian soldiers
            fighting outside, were manning the machine gun nest. Batra charged forward alone, killing all four
            members of the crew.[84]

            Batra realised one of his men had been shot. He resolved to evacuate him with Subedar Raghunath
            Singh. Batra exposed himself to enemy fire to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process
            was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper from very close range, and a split-second later, by a
            splinter from an RPG which hit him in the head.[86][24][88] Batra collapsed next to the injured
            soldier, succumbing to the fatal wounds.[83][24]
